Class-Based Views (CBVs) in Django provide an alternative way to define views by using Python classes instead of functions. 
They offer a more modular and reusable approach to handle common web development tasks such as rendering templates, processing forms, 
and managing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. CBVs encapsulate related functionality into methods, promoting better organization and code reuse. 
By inheriting from built-in generic views, such as `TemplateView`, `ListView`, `DetailView`, `CreateView`, `UpdateView`, and `DeleteView`, developers 
can quickly create views with minimal code while maintaining the flexibility to customize and extend as needed. 
This approach enhances code maintainability and readability, making it a preferred choice for complex Django applications.
